Labratory 1 exercise 9:

Pretty much everything in this labratory was new to me. I'm completely new to C++, aswell as object oriented programming.
Having almost no prior experience in coding, i felt like the exercises difficulty was at a good level. I had to think for most of them to get them right, but
it didn't take forever to complete them. The things we have gone over in the lessons intersected perfectly with the assignments.
The hardest assignment was probably number 5. Using scanf_s and printf_s felt a bit weird, and we hadn't gone over it a lot on the lessons. It ended up being a lot of
trial and error, and searching the web before finding a good solution that worked.
